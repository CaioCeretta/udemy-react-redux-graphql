On a browser window, we can click on the 3 dots and look for Rendering, then we can activate the paint flashing, what this does, is highlights the areas of the page that need to be repainted.
On the monsters rolodex example, if i create a new input field, which we can alter the title of the page, we can notice that whenever we type something on this, at the first time, the whole App component will re-render.
The reason for this is because of the reflow, a DOM needs to reflow whenever a component get's added on. It isn't on the added cases, as long as the layout needs to be shifted in the particular case.
In that case, when the h1 is empty, it has no height, even though the h1, we will notice it still is on the website, but it takes no height right now, but at the moment that it starts taking height, what it happens, is that i needs to shift the entire page down, because there is now a new element that is taking down space on the DOM, and that is basically reflow.
Generally speaking, this reflow process is not THAT expensive.
Another example, when we filter the monsters, as we type on the searchbox, we notice that as the cards get removed from the page, we are also reflowing the entire document, so this is also ok, we will see this pattern pretty much every time in a react app, so we don't have to be surprised when we see these big flashes on the screen, but the key thing to really notice is just the fact that when components are being mounted and unmounted, there is this reflow going on, which is essentially a paint process, however if everything is on the page, and this are just being modified, we notice that react will make sure to only modify the portions that are relevant.
