# What is GraphQL

GraphQl is a query language for APIs and runtime for executing those queries by utilizing a type system defined by
our data, here's a breakdown of GraphQL and its uses, as well as the Apollo Client

## Declarative Data Fetching
  - GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need. Clients can specify the exact structure and shape of the
data they require in a single query. This helps in reducing over-fetching (retrieving more data than needed) and 
under-fetching (having to make multiple requests to get required data)

## Strongly Typed Schema
- GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema that describes the types of data available and the relationship between them.
- This schema serves as a contract between the client and server, providing clear expectations for data requests and
responses

## Single Endpoint

- Unlike REST APIs which may have multiple endpoints for different resources, graphQL APIs typically have a single
have a single endpoint for all data operations

- Clients can send queries to this endpoint to retrieve, update, or delete data, which makes the API more efficient
and simpler to manage

## Real-time Data With Subscriptions

- GraphQL supports real-time data updates through subscriptions. Clients can subscribe to changes in data and receive
updates in real-time when those changes occur on the server

##  Introspection

- GraphQL APIs provide introspection capabilities, allowing clients to query the schema itself to discover available
types, fields and their relationship
- This makes GraphQL APIs self-documenting and enables powerful tooling for development

# Uses of GraphQL

## Mobile and Web Applications

- GraphQL is commonly used in mobile and web applications to efficiently fetch data from servers
- Its ability to tailor data responses to the specific needs of clients makes it ideal for optimizing network usage
and improving app performance

## Microservices architecture

- In a microservices architecture, where each service manages its data, GraphQL can serve as a unified interface for
querying data from multiple services.
- This simplifies the process of aggregating data from various sources and presenting it to clients in a consistent
manner

## API Gateway

- GraphQL can be used as an API gateway to aggregate and federate data from multiple underlying services
- It allows clients to access data from disparate sources through a single endpoint, reducing complexity and improving
maintainability

# Appolo Client

- Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript applications that consume GraphQL APIS.
It provides a powerful and flexible way to interact with GraphQL servers and manage local application state. Key features
include

## Declarative Data Fetching

- Apollo Client allows developers to declaratively fetch data using GraphQL queries directly in their components.
- Queries can be composed using GraphQL's expression syntax, making it easy to specify the exact data requirements for
each component

## Caching and Normalization

- Apollo Client automatically caches GraphQL query results in memory, improving performance by reducing redundant
network requests
- It also normalizes cached data, ensuring each piece of data is stored only once and can be efficiently reused
across the application

## Local State Management

- Apollo Client provides tools for managing local application state alongside remote data fetched from a GraphQL server
- Developers can define local queries, mutations and resolvers to interact with client-side data in a consistent manner

## Error Handling

- Apollo Client handles errors gracefully by providing mechanisms for error handling and retrying failed requests
- It also supports query batching, allowing multiple GraphQL queries to be sent in a single network request to reduce
latency and improve performance


# Summary

In summary, GraphQL is a powerful query language and runtime for APIs that offers numerous benefits, including efficient
data fetching, strong typing, real-time updates, and introspection.
Appollo Client is a popular JS library for consuming GraphQL APIs providing features such as declarative data fetching,
caching, local state management, and error handling. Together, GraphQL and Apollo Client offer a modern and efficient
solution for building a data-driven application
